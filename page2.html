                <blockquote> <strong>My Final Year Project </strong>aimed to explore the art of the remix and how it can transform a piece of music and change one's perspective. I have been a music producer since I was 15 years of age, So I wanted to show my compostion skills for my project. The process included researching into the history of remxing and genres, and gathering valuable information from different authors and producers on the art of the remix and also how people percieve genres.&nbsp;The process also included creating an original compositon, and remixing it 3 times into 3 different genres. This shows the main goal of my project: To show that with one piece of original music, the possibilties are endless.&nbsp;</blockquote>

                               <strong>The first part of the process </strong>involved creating the original composition. The composition included original melodies, basslines, chords, drums. It also includes orginal vocals from singer/songwriter Emma Cotter from Co.Cork. The aim of this composition was to create a popular deep house track, that would be suited for radio play.

                               <strong>The second part of the proces </strong>was to remix the original composition into another genre. After researching different genres, I decided to chose to remix the composition into trap ambient and techno, as they are quite different to each other. The first remix I created was the trap remix. Trap is mainly heaving hitting 808's and heavy chords, but i wanted to make the trap remix into something more relaxing. I took inspiration from artists such as australian producer Flume and Mura Masa.

As I wanted to show the endless possibilities with one piece of original music, I felt that creating an ambient version would show how it is possible to maniplate chords, melodies etc. Ambient is known for its slow, dreamy vibe that can either be played as background music, or used to be listened to in depth. What i did to portray this was grabbing the chords and stretching them to make a slow mellow sound. Also i reversed the vocals and put reeverb and delay to create a dreamy sound.

I wanted to get another producer to remix the main composition so that i would be able to ask the producer about his approach to the remix and gather insight from another person's perspective. The artist that I asked was deep house/techno producer from Co. Sligo, Gavin Rochford. He remixed the track into this smooth, melodic techno track that starts off quite minimal and gradually gets more complex.

The final results were that the favourite remix was the trap remix, and the least favourite was the ambient remix. The feedback from the users said that the trap remix was that the trap remix made the orginal more exciting and energetic. They said that the ambient remix was a bit borning and had no real drive.&nbsp;</p>
